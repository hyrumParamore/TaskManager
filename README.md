# Task Manager - JavaScript Console Program

This program that I decided to do was to create a task manager program that is written in JavaScript using Node.js. While there are many different types of task managers out there, I wanted to try to make this one unique in that it is made as a personal scrum meeting. What I mean by this is that when you create a task, it will create a set date (that being the current time it is created) and a due date (meaning that it is the date in which you need to have completed the tasks and update). The plan was that whenever a task reaches the due date, it would then show up and require you to update it and provide a new task for the next sprint (2 weeks), but I wasn't able to add all of the features I wanted. While I don't have a way for it to remind you yet, you are allowed to update a task whenever you want. That is a future function that I would like to incorporate.

The purpose of writing this program was to test my skills on building ideas that I have, planning them out in detail- hand-writing out the logic, and then creating it. It also allows me to practice JavaScript and use it in a way that I've never done before, that being making it all terminal based through Node.js and using Readline.js. It has also been really good practice with working with, arrays that contain objects, classes, and methods. And it has helped me to practice figuring out different forms of logic that are presented with the different problems that have arisen.

# Development Environment

* JavaScript
    * Node.js 
    * Readline.js
* Visual Studio Code
* Git / GitHub



# Useful Websites

- [Node.js v20.3.1 documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html)
- [Node.js Readline() Module](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node-js-readline-module/)


# Future Work

- Create a webapp or mobile app using this project as a baseline.
- Make it deployable so that when I create new tasks, it will create them, save them in a database, and then give you realtime reminders for when those tasks need to be completed or updated.
- Many people love to keep updated on their tasks by hand, so I think an awesome improvement would be to have an option to print out the tasks in a nice format so that you can use a pen or pencil to update or take notes. Then you could go in later and update it or take a picture and then it saves the image and uses that to update the original task.
